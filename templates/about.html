                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>This Master's project focuses on developing an AI-powered document summarization system capable of handling various document formats. The system aims to provide accurate and coherent summaries along with informative visualizations.</p>

                <h3>Plan for the Past Three Weeks</h3>
                <p>The plan for the past three weeks focused on enhancing the core functionalities of the document summarization system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Document Upload and Preprocessing:</strong> Implementing robust document upload for Word, PDF, text, and images, and developing comprehensive preprocessing logic with OCR for images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Summarization Integration:</strong> Refining the integration with the open-source llama model (via Ollama) to optimize summarization accuracy and coherence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization Development:</strong> Developing more informative and user-friendly visualizations using LangGraph to represent document summaries effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial System Testing:</strong> Conducting functionality and initial accuracy testing of the core components.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Progress Made</h3>
                <p>The core plan for the past three weeks has been successfully completed, with the integration of the backend with the LLM (Llama 3.1 8B via Ollama) achieved.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Document Upload and Preprocessing:</strong> Robust document upload in FastAPI now supports Word, PDF, text, and image formats. Comprehensive preprocessing, including OCR for images, ensures accurate text extraction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Summarization Integration:</strong> Seamless connectivity between preprocessed text and the Llama 3.1 8B model (via Ollama) has been established. Rigorous testing with various summarization techniques and parameters shows promising results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization Development:</strong> Informative visualizations using LangGraph have been developed and successfully integrated into the Streamlit user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial System Testing:</strong> Functionality testing across all components and initial accuracy testing of the summarization output have yielded satisfactory results.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges Overcome</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accurate Text Extraction from Diverse Document Formats:</strong> Complexity in handling varied PDF structures and images was overcome through careful implementation and testing of preprocessing techniques and the OCR engine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Achieving High Accuracy and Coherence in LLM-based Summarization:</strong> Optimizing the summarization process with Llama 3.1 8B required experimentation with prompts and model parameters, leading to good initial results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developing Effective Visualizations for Document Summaries:</strong> Designing intuitive visualizations with LangGraph required careful consideration of user experience and the summarized content, resulting in initial visualizations that effectively convey the essence of summaries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> Used for the backend to handle document upload and preprocessing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ollama:</strong> Used to host and serve the Llama 3.1 8B model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Llama 3.1 8B Model:</strong> The Large Language Model used for document summarization.</li>
                    <li><strong>LangGraph:</strong> Used for developing visualizations of document summaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Streamlit:</strong> Used for the user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>OCR Engine:</strong> Integrated for extracting text from images (specify the library if you know it, e.g., Tesseract).</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Libraries:</strong> (Mention any other relevant libraries like PyPDF2, python-docx, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
